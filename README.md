# Reflections on the Emergence of Spacetime and Quantum Fields

Welcome to this GitHub repository, which gathers a corpus of three research articles exploring a radical refoundation of fundamental physics.

**A New Paradigm for Quantum Gravity, Cosmology, and Fundamental Physics**

Spacetime, matter, and the laws of gravity emerge from a fundamental computational substrate governed by quantum information theory principles.

## Unifying Vision

Current physics theories - general relativity and quantum mechanics - describe with unprecedented precision the behavior of the Universe at their respective scales. Yet their reconciliation remains the Holy Grail of fundamental physics. Our work resolves this tension through an **epistemological inversion**:

> *"Spacetime is not a primitive container, but a structure derived from informational dynamics."* 

This approach rests on three complementary pillars detailed in the attached papers:

1. **Computational Complexity as the Foundation of Locality**  
   A fundamental limit Œ∫ on coherent degrees of freedom explains the emergence of spatial geometry (distance `ds¬≤ ‚àù log I(A,B)/Œ∫`)

2. **Modular Entropy as the Source of Gravity**  
   Generalization of Jacobson's equations via Tomita-Takesaki modular flow (`œÉ‚Çú`) and Mellin transform simultaneously reconstructs the metric `g‚Çò·µ•` and matter content `T‚Çò·µ•`

3. **Time as Computational Flow**  
   Cosmological time emerges as accumulated complexity (`œÑ_cosmo ‚àù ‚à´ ùíû d‚Å¥x`) in a causal qubit network under constraint `œÅ_calc = const`

## Transformative Implications

This framework enables us to:
- **Derive Einstein's equations** as thermodynamic equations of state for dynamic informational structures
- **Solve century-old enigmas**: finiteness of `c`, emergence of `D=3+1`, arrow of time
- **Predict observable signatures**: Lorentz violations (`Œîv ‚àº e^{-E/œÅ‚ÇÄ^{1/4}}`), CMB anomalies (`Œ¥_‚Ñì = A‚Ñì^{-3/2}e^{-Œ≥‚Ñì}`), variations of fundamental constants

3. **["Toward a Computational Refoundation of Spacetime and Quantum Fields"](./papers/RefondationComputationelle_EspaceTemps_QFT.pdf)**  
   This paper develops a theory where time itself emerges as information flow within a dynamic qubit network [cite: 146, 147]. It demonstrates how Lorentz invariance, Einstein's equations, and the arrow of time naturally derive from this causal computational substrate [cite: 149]. Testable predictions, such as Lorentz violations and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomalies, are also presented [cite: 150].

4. **["Holographic Entanglement, Quantum Gravity, and Fundamental Computational Complexity"](./papers/IntricationHolographique_ComplexiteComputationelle.pdf)**  
   This synthesis explores deep connections between holographic entanglement entropy, the emergence of Einstein's equations, and the crucial role of fundamental computational complexity [cite: 5, 44]. The paper proposes a unifying vision where spacetime locality results from an intrinsic limit on computing power [cite: 6, 44], integrating advances from string theory, loop quantum gravity, and quantum information theory [cite: 7].

5. **["Complexity_and_spatio-temporal_emergence"](./papers/Complexit√©_et_emegence_spatiotemporelle.pdf)**
   We propose an approach to computational complexity as a fundamental ingredient in the emergence of spatio-temporal geometry. By integrating perspectives from information theory, geometric dynamical systems, and quantum theories of space-time (notably the work of Finster and Miranda), we lay the foundations for a universal computational structure where complexity becomes a dynamic, topological, and asymptotic invariant.

6.  **["ADS_CFT_Correspondance"](./papers/ADS_CFT_Correspondance.pdf)**
   This paper interprets the AdS/CFT correspondence as a generalized **Stokes theorem**. The duality equates a conformal field theory (CFT) in *d* dimensions with a gravitational theory in AdS *(d+1)* dimensions, embodying the holographic principle: bulk information is encoded on the boundary. The work emphasizes an **information-theoretic view**, showing that AdS/CFT functions as a **quantum error-correcting code**. Bulk operators can be reconstructed from boundary regions,    ensuring robustness. Using **relative entropy** and the **modular Hamiltonian**, the JLMS/FLM results are recast as an ‚Äúinformational Stokes theorem,‚Äù where entanglement laws parallel Gauss‚Äô law. Spacetime emerges as a structure of quantum encoding.

7.  **["Scale_Inv_IS_Bound"](./papers/Scale_Inv_IS_Bound.pdf)**
   This paper interprets the Itakura-Saito (IS) loss through a **field-theoretic framework**, showing that minimizing IS loss corresponds to minimizing an energy functional for a prediction field. Linearization reveals a massive scalar field theory, with **conformal invariance** emerging in the large-target limit. This symmetry improves robustness by flattening the Hessian spectrum, yielding better optimization. A **unified causal bound**
   on information propagation in       networks is derived: while IS loss enhances conditioning, it cannot exceed architecture-imposed speed limits. Connections with **Neural Tangent Kernel dynamics** and holographic analogies are developed, and a 1D example illustrates how IS loss stabilizes and accelerates training within strict causal horizons.

8.  **["CFS_Holography_2025_Comments"](./papers/CFS_Holography_2025_Comments.pdf)**
   Recent work on **Causal Fermion Systems** (Finster, 2018; Dappiaggi et al., 2025) suggests that space-time and fields emerge from fermionic correlations: matter creates space by self-interaction. The familiar (1,3) signature and the notion of time appear only locally and asymptotically, while at the Big Bang or inside black holes, dimension and time may become undefined.
   We also    connected these insights with finite-propagation bounds in networks (NTK + IS-loss), pointing to a universal principle of limited propagation speed.

### Project Objective:

This repository aims to share and make accessible research converging toward a bold, unified vision of physics. By inverting the traditional causality where geometry and matter are primordial, these papers explore a new direction where information and computation are the ultimate constituents of reality.

We hope these documents will stimulate reflection, encourage new research, and facilitate understanding of these innovative concepts for researchers, students, and anyone interested in the frontiers of theoretical physics.
